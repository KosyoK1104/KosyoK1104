# 💻 Konstantin Kostadinov  

Hello! 👋 I’m Konstantin Kostadinov, a driven and enthusiastic developer hailing from the charming city of Varna, Bulgaria. Currently, I reside in Sofia, where I’m channeling my passion for technology while completing my final year of Informatics studies at New Bulgarian University (NBU).

As a developer at ThinkWeb, I specialize in creating robust, scalable, and user-focused web applications. I have a keen interest in exploring software architecture designs like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as building efficient infrastructures with principles such as microservices, microfrontends, modular monoliths, and RESTful APIs. My passion lies in crafting systems that are scalable, maintainable, and optimized for long-term success.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or brainstorming innovative solutions to challenging problems.
